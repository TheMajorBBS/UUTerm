'patches for QB4.5 and PDS. Upgrade to QB 5.0

1) MAKE A BACKUP COPY of your BCOM45.LIB or whatever you plan to patch,
just in case.

2) Dig out your favorite debugger or disk editor.  Haven't got one?
Pick up FED (File EDitor) or HEDIT (Hex Editor) at your local BBS.

3) Install patches of choice.

NOTE: The addresses shown below are the same on the above editors and
the same for XTREE. However if you are using another editor then those
just discussed, your addresses may or may not be the same.

Can also use these for PDS. The addresses will be different, so search
for the bytes involved instead of the addresses.

A) To prevent the COMMAND$ function from capitalizing the command line,
SEEK: 3C 61 72 06 3C 7A 77 02 34 20
MAKE: EB 08 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90

B) To prevent OPEN "COM..." from destroying the BIOS comm data area,
SEEK: 1E 33 D2 8E DA 87 95 00 04 1F
MAKE: 1E 33 D2 8E DA 8B 95 00 04 1F
SEEK: 1E 33 D2 8E DA 89 9D 00 04 1F

C} To prevent CLOSE or END from lowering the DTR on comm ports,
SEEK: B0 00 E3 01 40 83 C2 04 EE
MAKE: B0 00 90 90 40 83 C2 04 EE

Be advised that if you install that last patch, you will need to drop
the DTR manually if you want it lowered.

A) Allows for multiple colored text backgrounds in EGA/VGA mode.

File:  QB.EXE  (for QB 4.5)
Memory Location       SEEK          MAKE
   01D20F             76 03         EB 03
   021A81             72 33         90 90
   02231C             77 0D         90 90

File:  BCOM45.LIB
Memory Location       SEEK          MAKE
   0096A8             72 33         90 90
   00A256             76 03         EB 03
   00BA71             77 0D         90 90

B) Allows for a cursor in graphics mode

File:  QB.EXE  (for QB 4.5)
Memory Location       SEEK          MAKE
   020ABC             75 1A A1      72 1A A1
   020B8A             80 B0 DC      80 B0 ?? *(see below)

File:  BCOM45.LIB
Memory Location       SEEK          MAKE
   018FF6             75 1A A1      72 1A A1
   0190C4             80 B0 DC      80 B0 ?? *(see below)

* The cursor shape is at this address. Change the byte containing DC
only if you want to change the shape of the cursor. Your cursor can be
any ASCII character you choose. The value (ASCII value in hexadecimal)
is ONE more then the ASCII character.
Example: The byte originally contains DC,(subtract 1 and actually DB
is printed: Û ) I like char. 254 (FE þ ) so 255 (FF) should be put
in place of DC.

Use Locate ,,0 to turn cursor off, and Locate ,,1 to turn cursor on.

Now that you do all this.. you'll have your own personal copy of QB 5.0
