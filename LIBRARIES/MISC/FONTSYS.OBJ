1) Cut out this .BAS file, load into QB and run it. It will create an
.OBJ file in the current directory.

2)  Now that you the .OBJ file you need to turn it into a .LIB file for
    compiling and a .QLB file to use the fonts in QB. The following
    commands will do that...

    a) Type "LIB" to run QB's library manager (to make a .LIB file).
         At the LIBRARY prompt, type:  FONTS.LIB
         When asked to create a new file, type:  Y
         At the OPERATION prompt, type:  +fonts.obj
         At the LISTING prompt, just press <ENTER>

       Bingo! You now have FONTS.LIB

    b) To make a .QLB from the .LIB file, type:
         "LINK /QU FONTS.LIB, FONTS.QLB,, BQLB45.LIB

       If QB's BQLB45.LIB file is not in the current directory then
       don't forget to add a path to it in the above command.

    c) Type "DEL *.OBJ"
       Type "DEL *.MAP"
          Erases the extra files that are no longer needed.

3) If all has gone well you should now have a FONTS.LIB and a
   FONTS.QLB. (FONTS.LIB can be added to any other library you are
   currently using)

   If you would like to test it out and see if it works. Make sure the
   Fonts.QLB is in the same directory as QB. Then type:  QB /L Fonts

   QB will start and load the fonts library. Use the following
   code as a test that all works..
