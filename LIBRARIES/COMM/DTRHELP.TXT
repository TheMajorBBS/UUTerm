     '3 ways to not drop carrier when exiting QB
     Here are 3 of the methods I've collected off the QB conferences for
     keeping QB from hanging up in door programs.

 Method #1:  (Courtesy of Tom Hanlin)
     First and foremost make these changes to a COPY of your QB master
     disks. * * * DO NOT DO THIS TO YOUR QB MASTER DISK(S) FILES! * * *
     You need to patch the BCOM45.LIB file.

     Search for the following byte string:
     B0 00 E3 01 40 83 C2 04 EE

     Replace with the following byte string:
     B0 00 90 90 40 83 C2 04 EE

    "Be advised if you install the above patch you will need to drop
     the DTR manually if you want it lowered."

Method #2: (Like# 1 above but with details on how to do it. Courtesy of-
            Kenny Gardner)
     Before beginning MAKE SURE you are working on a BACKUP copy of
     QuickBASIC - NOT YOUR MASTER DISKS.
     With DEBUG in your DOS path type:
     Debug BCOM45.LIB
     You type :
     s cs:0 ffff b0 00 e3 01
     Debug should show :
     xxxx:1529
     where xxxx can be any number depending upon where Debug loaded the
     program in memory. In any case, the number is not important.
     You type :
     u 1529
     Debug should show :
     MOV AL, 0
     JCXZ 152E
     INC AX
     ADD DX, 4
     OUT DX, AL
     This is where QB graciously resets the comm port to parameters it
     thinks the comm port should have.
     To fix the problem, type :
     a 1529
     MOV AL, 1
     [ENTER]
     a 152d
     NOP
     [ENTER]
     where [ENTER] is the ENTER key - Do not type the characters!
     To verify that you typed everything correctly, type :
     u 1529
     Debug should show :
     MOV AL, 1
     JCXZ 152E
     NOP
     ADD DX, 4
     OUT DX, AL
     To save the corrections type :
     W
     Debug should show :
     Writing 35EF7 bytes
     Now type  Q  and you are finished patching BCOM45.LIB

Method #3:

     (Courtesy of John Gallas via FidoNet QuickBASIC conference)

     This isn't a patch, but reportedly "the following routine when
     used right after CLOSEing the COM port will bump the DTR right
     back up and the modem won't even notice it was down."

     DECLARE SUB SetDTR (Setting)
DEFINT A-Z

     Of the above 3 methods I would choose #1 (Tom Hanlin's) although
     it assumes you know what you're doing. Hope that helps.

     SUB SetDTR (Setting%)
     ' For COM1 the address is  &H3F8. For COM2 it is &H2F8.
     ' Setting% = True then DTR is raised
     ' Setting% = False then DTR is lowered
     PortAddress = &H3F8                     ' com port 1 example
     IF Setting% THEN
        OUT PortAddress + 4, INP(PortAddress + 4) OR 1
     ELSE
        OUT PortAddress + 4, INP(PortAddress + 4) AND &HFE
     END SUB
