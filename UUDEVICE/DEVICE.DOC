Check this baby out.
This is a rework of the Federation's own shield bypass system.
This will instantaneously defeat the Federation Warp Shield and bring you
into dock around Sol.
While it is true that it destroys itself in the attempt this device can
be a real lifesaver if you are "floating" helpless in space.

This device takes two Warp Links that connect to a Sector and fuses them
together so that the two Sectors are now connected.
Confused? Okay, let's use an example:
   
  Say Sector 34 connects to Sector 13, and Sector 22 also connects to 13.
  By using this device in Sector 13, you could connect Sector 34 to 
  Sector 22.

The advantage to this is two fold. One, only the Warp Shielding of the
Sector the device is used in, matters (Sector 22 in our example). And 
two, you needn't be in either of the affected areas.

Stop! - Read! - This is a Must Have Device!

This is the last line of defense to save your WarShip. If your WarShip
is attacked and about to be destroyed the Trap Door will:

    1) Fire all defenses (except Dead Man Switch)
    2) Jettision Destruction-Like Debree
    3) Transmit a Destruction Signal
    4) When hidden by debree, drop down the O.R.M. Link.
    5) Attempt to remain in the link for as long as possible.

The effect of these actions, is that your Ship appears destroyed
(Even to the Feds who will transfer your Debt, Fines and Credits to
your attacker.) and might not turn up if the destination Sector is
scanned.
However this device triggers much later in the attack than other devices
(like the Emergency Warp) so more serious damage is done to teh Ship, but
as the last resort....

capable of shunting itself and so ends up in another location within
the same Dimension.

Drones set to Wander/Subversive add a strategic level to space
combat.  You can release them, and let them do their work at no
risk to yourself.  However once victory is achieved it was almost
impossible to gather your forces.

The Stand Down sends a specially encoded Signal that causes all Attack
Drones set by your Ship to Wander Viciously or Subvert to Deactivate.
Stopping their movement makes it much easier to pick them up.

This device has the dubious honor of being the most expensive Specialty
Device for sale in the Federation.

It contains all functionality of a Master Replicator with storage
capabilities that would make a Hyper Cube envious!

Simply feed in the Pattern of a Device and this Paan device will produce
one per day and store it in it's own Hyper Spacial Area. It will then
deliver them upon demand.
There is no practical upper limit to how many devices it can store!

Now is that worth every penny?

This does everything the Paan Ifth does and more!
Like the Paan Ifth the Redeph can merge two passive devices into one
device bay. The Redeph, though, goes beyond that to allow the merging
of devices that have on/off switches. With these semi-passive devices
the Redeph fuses the on/off switch on.

An expensive device .... and worth every credit.
Developed by Paan metaphysisists this device uses their ultradimensional
theories to merge almost any two passive devices so that they only take
one slot, yet still function!
It is true that a very few types of devices malfunction when packed but
almost all work fine. Notable exceptions being Mine Deflectors, Particle
Weapons, and Bay Protectors.
So if you have space problems, and a cube isn't your answer try the Ifth.

valuable Paan devices. Now with the new Paan Scrubber unwanted devices

important tasks.

It has a simple Nspace transmitter and what appears to be some kind of
proximity detector. Other than that we're clue less.

This is a Cabal device and we are not sure exactly what it does.
It has what appears to be some sensor circuitry.
It also has a plasma coupling conduit, but it is definitely not a warp
device, we think.
Puzzling....

Before the advent of the Fusion Cell, space travel was severely limited
by the amount of fuel a Ship could carry. Serrin Marcus' Ore Conversion
Cell allowed ships to travel further by converting it's Cargo ore into
fuel. The Marcus Cell was modified a little after the Fusion Cell was
created, but is now really just useful in an emergency situation.

Ore   is translated to Fuel Units at 1 Unit per 10000 Units.
Power is translated to Fuel Units at 1 Unit per 40000 Units.

This Planetary Device adds the ability to drive a Warrior Class Planet
into any adjacent Sector. Due to the extremely delicate gravity
manipulations that must be performed, the Planetary Engine automatically
shuts down if it detects another planet in the vicinity. We hope a have a
"Ramming Engine" capable of overcoming the deficiency, out by the end of
the year.

Warning:
   Attack Drones and Sector Mines are smart enough not to attack
   anything the size and mass of a planet, however they are very
   alert to it's presence and will attack your Ship the moment it
   disembarks the planet.

Retail Value: 35000
Available at Port Sol.
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Federation WarShips come equiped with an Encoded Command Signal, often
referred to as the Ship ID. It is this Signal that allows external
devices (Drones, Sector Mines, Planets, etc.) to know who they are
belong to. This is why you might Captain more than one WarShip, but
each maintains it's own empire of external objects.
While this safety measure keeps other WarShips from controlling, or
gaining control of your Empire, it can be a tremendous pain when you
require something controlled by another Ship of your Fleet.
Command Assignation allows you to transfer control of external devices
from another Ship in your Fleet to your Current Ship.
The Signal sent only reaches to the adjacent Sector.
Be Warned: Once initialized, should another Captain manage to get hold
           of this device, they will be able to control all your Empires.

Retail Value: 6500000

When Dr. Augusta first published his Harmony Wave theories, they were
scoffed at and ridiculed. However, using these theories we have
constructed a device to establish a Harmony Wave within a Warp Shielding
Field. As long as the Field is stable nothing seems different but should
a device de-stablize the Field (Like a Warp Shield Wedge) even slightly,
the resulting feedback will destroy the device.
Once established the resulting Harmony Wave can only be collapsed by
nullifying the Warp Shield Field.
