So you want to learn Ultimate Universe, heh? 

When you first play, there 2 specials going that you should take 
advantage of. First the port in sector 1 is giving big discounts the 
first 3 days. Use this to your advantage by buying as many holds as possible
within the first 3 days (you should be able to get all 60,000 the first day).

Secondly, the port in sector 6 will give you your first item FREE, as 
long as the cost is 500,000 or less. So get the most expensive item
allowed. This is where a 3rd party utility can really pay off. Use
UUDEVICE to list the devices in this price range.

*********************************************************
Here is my strategy for the first three days...

1) Go to sector 6 and buy device #178. It will be FREE as long as this is
your first time there. This device is silencer pack that will turn off port
displays so you can trade very quickly.

2) Now you need to buy the following items:

Device #37.   Auto Pilot [10]                  (6) Retail Value:12350      
Device #40.   Random Emergency Warp Device     (6) Retail Value:78500      
Device #92.   Explorer Path Deluxe             (6) Retail Value:294999     
Device #161.  Starter Pack                     (6) Retail Value:128695     
Device #165.  Danger Pack                      (6) Retail Value:108000     
Device #212.  The Auto Trader                  (6) Retail Value:10000      
Device #276.  The Gosub                        (8) Retail Value:913000     
Device #363.  Infected Port Detector           (8) Retail Value:140000     
Device #411.  Special Devices Detection Pack   (8) Retail Value:500000     

All devices numbered 240 or less are at sector 6 the rest are in sector 8

*TIP* You can have UUDEVICE create a UU macro that will automatically
      buy all the items for you. Simply enter the above items into your
      picklist, then instruct UU to create the macro. 
      (See UUDEVICE.DOC for more info)

To get you started even quicker..here is the macro that you can load into
your comm programs View window, then cut a paste onto the UU command
line. Cut, paste, and execute one line at a time.(make sure your ship
is in sector 8 when you start the macro):

P;B;276;Y;B;363;Y;B;411;Y;Q;
M;7;M;6;P;B;37;Y;B;40;Y;B;92;Y;B;161;Y;B;165;Y;B;212;Y;Q;

3) Now that you have all your items use the "U" command at the main menu.
From here you can turn on any device that is off. TIP: keep #178 (the
Silencer Pack) off until you are actually ready to start trading.

4) Now that everything is on the ship and activated, you need to make 
some quick credits. Go to sector 10 and port. Access the port menu.
Here you can get a list of ports and what they have to offer.

Look for a port that sells Water. Look at the prices they charge. Try to 
find one that sells Water around 20 and buys Power at 22 or more.

Now look for a port that sells Power around 16 and buys Water at 27 or
more. Make sure each port has plenty of the commodities on hand.
Now that you have one of each, these will make up your paired port.

TIP: It is wise to get at least 3 ports each of Water and Power in case one
port is infected or blocked by Cabal.

5) In order to trade for big bucks you need lots of holds. Go to sector
1 now. First buy 4 Gate warps (used to connect your 2 ports together),
Then buy as many holds as you have credits.

6) Now you are ready to go to your paired port. Use device #92 to make
sure you have a clear path to one of your ports (type: V;92). If all is
clear use device #37 (type: V;37) to take you to one of your ports.

7) Now that you are in a sector that has one of your ports, you need to 
use the Gate Warp to attach the other port to this one (provided the port
is not infected-your Infected Port Detector will warn you). Press "W;2" to
do that. Now move to your second port which should now be an adjacent
sector. Again use the "W;2" command to link the second port back to the first.
Now you have two great ports next to each other.

9) The fastest way to trade is to use a macro and make sure you have
device #178 on. To make the macro enter: P;M;#;P;M;#\ (where # is the
sector number the 2 ports are in). To start trading hit "<CTRL> N".
Do it over and over until you have enough credits to double your holds.

10) Once you have enough to double your holds (should still have 140
turns left) you need to get back to sector 1 and buy more holds. This
is where the GoSub you bought comes in. Use it to take you to sector
1. Buy your holds and use the Gosub to return back to your paired port.
(The first time you use the Gosub, you will need to move to sector 1 to 
lock onto that sector. From then on you can use it to go back and forth
in only 2 turns)

11) Use your macro again to start your trading. After about 40 more
turns you should have enough credits to double your holds again
Do it again after 40 more turns.

12) When you're down to 10 or so moves, use the GoSub to take you back
to one. Buy as many holds as possible. If any money is left over, buy
as many Anti-Cloaks as possible (eventually you'll need about 20,000)
(Tip: if you have plenty of time left, buy more turns instead. You can
then keep trading for more bucks)

13) Move to a sector that has Fed drones and mines in it. Quit the game.
    Put the extra turns in your fusion cell.

****************** First day is over ************************

At the end of your second day of trading you should have maximum holds.

Once you have Max holds start accumulating cloaks and anti-cloaks.
I like to get about 5003 cloaks and 20,000 anti-cloaks before proceeding.

You should have max holds and the above cloaks/anti-cloaks before the
third day ends. After the third day is over, all prices on these items
go up to full value. GET THEM WHILE THEY ARE CHEAP!

If you want to know what to do after the third day, then please register.
I'll send you more tips on what to do from here. Things like; what devices
are best for exploration, which devices are best at finding other planets,
and the best way to defend your planet.

Well that's all for now. Please register and I'll send you even more
tips. Thanks for trying UUDEVICE.
