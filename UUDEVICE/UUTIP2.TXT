*******************      Backgrounf Info      ********************

First, d/l UUDEV14.ZIP (device manager) and UUSTART1.ZIP (beginners help
file), also d/l UU161.ARJ (this is the game itself).
Check these names to make sure they are spelled right. BTW, if you d/l
UU161 then UUSTART1 will be in it, no need to d/l duplicates.

Playing the game at home on your own computer is the BEST advice I can
give. You see, in UU if you lose your ship, you lose EVERYTHING you own
including planets. Therfore before you do anything on-line, you should
test it out on your home game.

Secondly, try to get the TW conference on RIME or Metrolink. The UU
author is active there and can answer any questions. Also many tips and
strategies are discussed.

Oh yeah, if you d/l UU161 there is another program in there called
UUHELP that gives info about the game that is helpful.

Now that we have all the software tools out of the way, lets get down to
playing.

Goal in UU: There are 4 Taakian artifacts (most hidden on planets) in
the game that you must find. Once you acquire all 4, you can create a
device called the Supreme Attentuator. When you have the SA device and use
it...Whamm---- You end the game and become Lord of Creation. All players
are kicked out, AND you are allowed to create your own custom universe
and rules, that all other players must abide by.

*********************   How To Progress In UU   ******************

Now lets get into play. I personnaly think there are 4 stages to UU
that must be kept in mind.

1) Your first 3 days playing. This is the most crucial step and prepares
you for the rest. In your first three days in the game, you are given
BIG discounts at port 1. Take advantage of this by buying all your holds
(60,000) and as many Ant-Cloaks and Cloaks as possible.

There are several files out that will tell you what to do the first few
days. One such file can be found with my UU utility UUDEV13.ZIP (UUDEV14
soon to be released).

2) After that you are set for stage 2. Find a sector that has a port
that sells ALL. Here you will make your home planet. Create a planet and
put up the neccessary defenses. Then try to put all the stuff in the
port on your planet. To do this you need MUCHO credits (35-50 mill).
Maybe spend one more day trading at a paired port for the cash.

Once you have finished this stage, you'll probably never need to trade
again. My best day so far has been 6 billion credits in one day.

Stage 3) This is where you build a daily salary (yes you can get credits
for FREE from the Feds), explore and Wreak havoc on other players and
planets. This is where the fun begins.

First you need to start Cabal hunting (you'll need a bunch of devices
for that). Start exploring the universe with the Grand Travellar. Make
sure you have a Cabal Invasion Pack, and a Heavy Particle Beam will also
help. The Travellar makes moving easier, the Invasion Pack allows you to
reprot the Cabal you find to the Feds who will give you money for the
info. And the Particle Beam will kill Cabal without the need of one
single fighter(drone). More on this later.

Not only do you get paid for each Cabal drone you report, but you can
earn a salary by destroying the Cabal. While in UU hit C;O to see how
much you earn per day. I'm at 250 million credits a day now. As you
can see I no longer need to trade. The money is put on your ship each
day when you first log on.

The fastest way to find Cabal to kill is to again use your Invasion Pack
and "Request a Mission" from the Feds. They will tell you where the
Cabal is, you go into the sector of Cabal and your Particle Beam 
vapoizes them and you get the money. DON'T go into the sector if it has
mines unless you have weapons to destroy the mines. If you come across
this situation it requires a different approach.

Also if you have an extra 35 mil laying around, go to port 10 and get a
Multiple Targeting Enhancer. This will multiply your firepower x 65.
With one of those and the Particle Beam, you can destroy 3.5 million
drones at a time. More than you will need to destroy drones in a sector,
and VERY helpful when invading planets as many have 3.5 million on the
surface in defense (which is why when you build a planet, you better put
more than 3.5 million drones on it if you want to keep me out).

Oh yeah, before exploring, make sure you have a Random Emergency Warp
device. This will protect you in case you accidently wander into a
sector with mines.

4) Once you have a good salary and money coming in, you can then spend
your time looking for the 4 artifacts, destroying Cabal planets,
messing with others, etc..

***************   How To Travel To Other Dimensions  *************

      1. Go to Port 9 and get the Free Dimensional Booster Signal.
         This will keep your holdings in other dimensions active.
         Do not put it in a Cube, a Paan or the FSA.

      2. Get a Pan Dimensional Viewer.
         This will allow you to look before you leap.

      3. Get a Pan Dimensional Drive
         (a few Dimensional Wedges is a good idea as well in case of
          outlawed devices in other dimensions.)

Also it is best to stalk up on supplies as they may not be available in
the other dimensions.

Use the Pan Dim Viewer to see it the coast is clear and then if it is
use the Dim Drive to go there. If it isn't move to another Sector and
try again. Repeat procedure when returning to the previous dimension
even if you are in the same sector.

*************  How To Destroy Other Ships And Planets  ***************

To destroy another player, use a Ship To Ship Scanner to see how many
drones they have and if a Dead Man's Switch is present.

A heavy radiation sheilding device # 294 from port 8 will counter the
deadman's switch if they have one. To take out the drones, just make sure
you have more then they do when attacking. You can also leave drones or
mines in their sector so they will destroy themselves when they log on.

The way to take a planet is sonic thumpering it to just about extinction...
First, use a Planetary Probe (available at port 1) to check the planets
defenses. If it is weak, usually one Sonic Thumper will destroy it. If it
has many drones and mines, the Sonic Thumper will kill those off so you can
invade with your drones. Before you invade though, Probe it again to make
sure it is weak enough. Then Force a landing.

If your Sonic Thumpers dont work then you need to attack the planetary
device with a planetary device missile until your thumper starts working.
Its best to use about 30 planetary device missiles on a planet first just
to make sure you have destroyed the devices... it doesnt tell you if you
have or not so the more the better.

You should get a Team Cube and load it with all your important devices and
then get Two Bay Protectors and space them with the juxtapose command to
cover all your bays with protection, then you make sure you have lots of
drones and land on the planet.

*******************  One Way To Design Your Ship  ********************

Anyway to destroy and pillage I have configured my ship in the following
manner which has worked well for me:

1                           13
2  Two Bay protector        14 Two Bay protector
3                           15
4                           16
5  Two bay protector        17 Two bay protector
6                           18
7                           19
8  two bay protector        20  Two Bay protector
9                           21
10                          22
11 Two bay protector        23  Two bay protector
12                          24

With this set-up I have been hit by battle debris and more and never
lose a bay. In fact I walk into sector with 1000 mines and don't get
hurt.

This leaves me 12 free bays.
1) 1 and 3 have my Cube(20)s.
2) 4 and 6 have my Paan Ifths' one has 2 anti-cloak enhancer and the
   other 2 cloak enhancers.
3) 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19 , and 21 carry all my sensors, macro
   computer, Cabal invasion
4) 22 and 24 are kept open in order to take items out of the cubes.
   While exploring, you can use these 2 for a Drone coordinator or
   whatever. When trading, put trading things there etc...

My 2 Cubes contain the following: 1 carries all my 'Planetary' missles
and Sonic Thumpers for invading. The other carries weapons and devices I
can use in sectors or against other players.

Been very successful with this simple setup. Only 62 devices here, But
if an item comes up I can always go to the store and get it. After an
invasion I always make sure to go back and fill up my cube with missles
again.
