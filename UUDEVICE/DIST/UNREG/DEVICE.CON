Device #263.  Warp Link Connector              (8) Retail Value: 275000
This device takes two Warp Links that connect to a Sector and fuses them
together so that the two Sectors are now connected.
Confused? Okay, let's use an example:
   
  Say Sector 34 connects to Sector 13, and Sector 22 also connects to 13.
  By using this device in Sector 13, you could connect Sector 34 to 
  Sector 22.

The advantage to this is two fold. One, only the Warp Shielding of the
Sector the device is used in, matters (Sector 22 in our example). And 
two, you needn't be in either of the affected areas.
Device #264.  Trap Door Retreat                (8) Retail Value: 137690
Stop! - Read! - This is a Must Have Device!

This is the last line of defense to save your WarShip. If your WarShip
is attacked and about to be destroyed the Trap Door will:

    1) Fire all defenses (except Dead Man Switch)
    2) Jettision Destruction-Like Debree
    3) Transmit a Destruction Signal
    4) When hidden by debree, drop down the O.R.M. Link.
    5) Attempt to remain in the link for as long as possible.

The effect of these actions, is that your Ship appears destroyed
(Even to the Feds who will transfer your Debt, Fines and Credits to
your attacker.) and might not turn up if the destination Sector is
scanned.
However this device triggers much later in the attack than other devices
(like the Emergency Warp) so more serious damage is done to teh Ship, but
as the last resort....

make it nearly impossible for a Sensor bound missile to approach it
without being shunted to another Dimension itself.
The Dimensional Catapult Catapult sets up an illusion that tricks the
Dimensional Catapult into launching itself into the Dimensional Breach!
Do to the method of the Catapults Dimensional Engine it is not actually
capable of shunting itself and so ends up in another location within
the same Dimension.

This does everything the Paan Ifth does and more!
Like the Paan Ifth the Redeph can merge two passive devices into one
device bay. The Redeph, though, goes beyond that to allow the merging

the Redeph fuses the on/off switch on.
Device #450.  The Paan Ifth                    (8) Retail Value: 650000

almost all work fine. Notable exceptions being Mine Deflectors, Particle
Weapons, and Bay Protectors.
So if you have space problems, and a cube isn't your answer try the Ifth.

can be Scrubbed out of existance, leaving your Paan free for more
important tasks.

down your enemies shields, then seconds before his Devices would be
destroyed, pushes those devices safely up into HyperSpace where the Cage
can later retrieve them.
The Cage can hold 8 devices.
Use of multiple Cages may lead to malfunction.

It has a simple Nspace transmitter and what appears to be some kind of
proximity detector. Other than that we're clue less.
Device #485.  Green & Yellow Cylinder          (8) Retail Value: 1100000
This is a Cabal device and we are not sure exactly what it does.
It has what appears to be some sensor circuitry.
It also has a plasma coupling conduit, but it is definitely not a warp
device, we think.
Puzzling....
Device #486.  Small Black Trapezoid            (8) Retail Value: 900000

This is a Cabal device.
We can't even crack the casing on this one...

It could be anything in our Catalog.
Different every time.

The Taakian Coordinator is the only discovered Taakian Artifact of which
there are multiples. The Taakian Coordinator is produced by the "Wandering
Port", The Procurator. The Procurator offers this Taakian Artifact up for

This Signal Device forwards your Team Signal to the computer of a nearby
Ship. If the Ship is not already the member of a Team it will accept
your Signal and function as a member of your Team.

This is specifically useful with new fleet ships.  As soon as you
take delivery you can add it to the team, avoiding the standard 24
wait imposed on new team member applications by F.C Legal.
Device #495.  Marcus Cell                      (1) Retail Value: 100000

Before the advent of the Fusion Cell, space travel was severely limited
by the amount of fuel a Ship could carry. Serrin Marcus' Ore Conversion
Cell allowed ships to travel further by converting it's Cargo ore into
fuel. The Marcus Cell was modified a little after the Fusion Cell was
created, but is now really just useful in an emergency situation.

Ore   is translated to Fuel Units at 1 Unit per 10000 Units.
Power is translated to Fuel Units at 1 Unit per 40000 Units.

Device #496.  Planetary Probe Enhancer         (1) Retail Value: 10000

The Factory Output Enhancer doubles the output of any Onboard Factory.
Be warned however that there is a 3% chance that this increased output
will permanently damage the factory.
Also note, that while often confused for one, The Master Replicator is
NOT a Factory.
Device #498.  Warrior Planet Engine            (1) Retail Value: 100000
This Planetary Device adds the ability to drive a Warrior Class Planet
into any adjacent Sector. Due to the extremely delicate gravity
manipulations that must be performed, the Planetary Engine automatically
shuts down if it detects another planet in the vicinity. We hope a have a
"Ramming Engine" capable of overcoming the deficiency, out by the end of
the year.

Warning:
   Attack Drones and Sector Mines are smart enough not to attack
   anything the size and mass of a planet, however they are very
   alert to it's presence and will attack your Ship the moment it
   disembarks the planet.
Device #499.  Warrior Planet Generator         (1) Retail Value: 100000
Breeder Planets are great for production but for a planet that can really
defend itself, you need a Warrior Class Planet.
Only half the production of a Breeder Class Planet, however it more than
makes up for that with the following features:

         1. Easy Mobility
         2. Defensive and Offensive Lasers
         3. More to Come.
Device #500.  Breeder Planet Converter         (1) Retail Value: 100000

Device #502.  Device ID Scrambler              (1) Retail Value: 100000
Stop others from gauging your defenses.
This Device puts up a field around each device (similar to the Chameleon
Field) that changes the ID signal of the Device to a random ID signal.
It therefor completely masks the devices on your ship.
Note: Does not function on devices in FSA or LSA.
Device #503.  Command Assignation              (1) Retail Value: 35000
Federation WarShips come equiped with an Encoded Command Signal, often
referred to as the Ship ID. It is this Signal that allows external
devices (Drones, Sector Mines, Planets, etc.) to know who they are
belong to. This is why you might Captain more than one WarShip, but
each maintains it's own empire of external objects.
While this safety measure keeps other WarShips from controlling, or
gaining control of your Empire, it can be a tremendous pain when you
require something controlled by another Ship of your Fleet.
Command Assignation allows you to transfer control of external devices
from another Ship in your Fleet to your Current Ship.
The Signal sent only reaches to the adjacent Sector.
Be Warned: Once initialized, should another Captain manage to get hold
           of this device, they will be able to control all your Empires.
Device #504.  Automatic Command Assignation    (1) Retail Value: 350000
Federation WarShips come equiped with an Encoded Command Signal, often
referred to as the Ship ID. It is this Signal that allows external
devices (Drones, Sector Mines, Planets, etc.) to know who they are
controlled by. This is why you might Captain more than one WarShip, but
each maintains it's own empire of external objects.
While this safety measure keeps other WarShips from controlling from
gaining control of your Empire, it can be a tremendous pain when you
require something controlled by another Ship of your Fleet.
Command Assignation allows you to transfer control of external devices
from another Ship in your Fleet to your Current Ship.
This Signal is sent Automatically to any Object you approach.
Be Warned: Once initialized, should another Captain manage to get hold
           of this device, they will be able to control all your Empires.

Device #507.  Augusta Harmony Wave             (1) Retail Value: 6500000
When Dr. Augusta first published his Harmony Wave theories, they were
scoffed at and ridiculed. However, using these theories we have
constructed a device to establish a Harmony Wave within a Warp Shielding
Field. As long as the Field is stable nothing seems different but should
a device de-stablize the Field (Like a Warp Shield Wedge) even slightly,
the resulting feedback will destroy the device.
Once established the resulting Harmony Wave can only be collapsed by
nullifying the Warp Shield Field.
