*************************************************************************
What's new in 2.1

Mainly fixed a bug that omitted certain devices from the search.

*************************************************************************
To run UUDEVICE for the first time, take  the following steps:

                     For Floppy Drives

     1. Boot DOS (version 3.0 or later) on your system.
     2. Put the UUDEVICE Master disk into drive A.
     3. Logon to drive A: by typing:  "A:"
     4. Make sure the data files Device.Con or Device.Doc is on the
        same disk as the UUDEVICE program.
     5. Type: UUDEV

                     For Hard Drives

     1. Boot DOS (version 3.0 or later) on your system.
     2. Copy UUDEVICE files to the directory where you store your
        Ultimate Universe data files or create one if just starting out.
     3. Type: UUDEV

***************************************************************************
What is UUDEVICE

UUDEVICE is an off-line (can be used on-line) utility for the popular BBS
door game Ultimate Universe.

A utility such as this allows you to plan your next days strategy off-line
at your own leisure. Thereby allowing you more time on-line for other good
stuff.

UUDEVICE is a database manager for the 500 devices found in UU. Having 500
devices to choose from can be very confusing , not to mention time
consuming to study.

That's where UUDEVICE comes in handy. Think of it as a SEARS catalog. You 
can search for a device by name, description, or price. If you find a 
device you like, you can add it to your shopping list.

Once your shopping list is done, you can view it, save it, or edit it.
You can also ask UUDEVICE to create a macro that can be used on-line to
handle all your shopping automatically. This can be a BIG time saver.

***************************************************************************
How to use UUDEVICE 

For UUDEVICE to function it needs a database. In fact it uses two files.
One is called DEVICE.CON and the other DEVICE.NAM. Where do you get these
files?

DEVICE.NAM is created from DEVICE.CON and is a text file of the device
names. As long as you have DEVICE.CON, UUDEVICE can create this one.

DEVICE.CON is a text file of the device names and descriptions. I am
including a DEVICE.CON file here with this utility. However, should you
lose it, or perhaps a newer version of UU should come out with more devices,
then UUDEVICE can create a new DEVICE.CON file from the DEVICE.DOC file
that comes with UU.

The following is an explanation of the various options in UUDEVICE


                     <<<<<    CONVERT     >>>>>

This option only appears on the main menu when there is no database for
UUDEVICE to work with.  Use this if you lose your DEVICE.CON file, or
if you want to upgrade your database to a newer version of ULTIMATE
UNIVERSE (current version as of this writing..2.02).

                   <<<<<    SEARCH BY TEXT     >>>>>

This option allows you to search device names and descriptions for a
matching text string. Really helpful for finding items that pertain to
a particular task.

For instance.. enter "Cabal" or "cabal" for devices that pertain to the
Cabal. Or try "Warp" for items that help/discourage warping. Play with
it and see what you come up with.

All groups of devices can optionally be saved to disk automatically.

*TIP:  this feature is case sensitive. So entering "warp" or "Warp" will
produce two different lists. However, if you save both lists to disk,
you can merge them into 1 using the new MERGE feature.
 
                  <<<<<    SEARCH BY PRICE    >>>>>

Don't find much use for this, but it does help locate the FREE items.
The most useful use for this is before you have ever played UU. You
see.. the first time you play, the store at port 6 gives you 500,000 credit
towards any device. Naturally you'd want to choice an item that costs as
near to 500,000 as possible.

To find those items, enter at the prompt: >400000<500000
This shows all devices greater than 400,000 credits yet less than 500,000

Other valid parameters are.. >10000000 to list all items over 10 mil.
Or <1 to show all FREE items.

                   <<<<<    SEARCH BY NAME    >>>>>

This is the option that creates the DEVICE.NAM file needed by UUDEVICE.
If the DEVICE.NAM already exists, then you can use this to view the names
of the 500 devices. You'll also get info on where to buy the device, along
with it's price.


                      <<<<<    PICKLIST    >>>>>

The Picklist (shopping list) allows you to save the devices you like to
memory. You can save up to 24 items. To enter a device number into your
shopping list, hit the INSERT key or click on the right mouse button.

The Picklist menu offers options to help you manage your shopping list.
You can Edit it to remove devices you no longer want. View it, print it,
and/or save it to disk.

                        <<<<<    MACRO    >>>>>

This option allows you to take a Picklist that is in memory, and make a
macro that will do your shopping automatically.

When the macro is made it is saved to disk. To use the macro, open your
communications program's View (or Edit) window and load the .MAC file 
you want into it. Then Cut and Paste the macro to the screen to execute.

WARNING NOTE:  

The macros created here, only work with UU 2.02 or later. If you
are still playing in UU 1.63 then you will have to skip this or modify
the macro to work with the ports in UU 1.63. You see, starting with 
UU 2.02 the location of the ports have changed.

UUDevice will create 2 different macros depending on your needs.
The BUYFED.MAC deals with the ports in the main Fed strip. Ports 1 thru 7.
Start this macro in sector 1 and it will move to all the necessary ports
buying what it needs.

The BUYALIEN.MAC works only at the port, Alien Devices, LTD. You'll have
to find that port then go there to run that macro. This port is located
in the secondary Fed strip called the Fringe.

                        <<<<<    PRINT    >>>>>

The Print menu allows you to print the .DEV and .LST files you have created.
You can also use this to print the names, prices, and locations of the near
500 devices in the game.

If you start printing and wish to escape before done, then hit the <ESC>
key. This will stop sending info to the printers buffer.

NOTE: the  print buffer may have info in it before you abort. In that case
it will keep printing what is left in the buffer before it stops. If you
have a large buffer, this could take some time. In the meantime, UUDEVICE
is free to use while the printer is finishing up. If you don't want what's
left in the buffer, then just turn off the printer.
