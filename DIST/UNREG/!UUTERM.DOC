How To Register UUTERM  (please use Order.Frm to register)

If you like what you see here and are a serious UU player who wants real
power, then please support the development of UUTERM. All monies
received will go right back into creating a better program with more of
the features you want (just send what you want and I'll try to put it in). 
As you can see, UUTERM is making a major step forward, to the Ultimate
utility. Combining on-line use as a term program, and also off-line as a
stand-alone offline utility.

*************************************************************************
What is UUTERM

UUTERM is an off-line utility for strategy mapping.
UUTERM is a terminal program designed specifically for use in playing
Ultimate Universe the popular BBS door game.

The advantage of using UUTERM is that it is custom designed just for
playing the game. Thus you have a lot of features that your normal
term program like Telemate or QModem can't offer.

Not only that, it also helps to add to the realism of the game. UUTERM
is designed with 3D graphics, and arranged to give the appearance of an
actual ships console. Thus you feel like you are really at the helm of
your vessel as you travel through space.

I have a lot more ideas to implement to make UUTERM an even better tool for
playing UU. If you don't want to miss out on more features and excitement
then please register today!

***************************************************************************
To run UUTERM take  the following steps:

There are 3 ways to use UUTERM:

1) Offline. UUTERM can be run offline for various things. To start UUTERM
offline, just type: UUTERM. When asked if you want to dial a BBS, choose
NO. That's it.

2) You can use UUTERM to dial into a BBS. Again, type: UUTERM. Choose
YES when asked if you want to dial a BBS. Once online, go into UU and play.

3) If you need to use your comm program for logging onto the BBS (in case
you want/need to do other things on-line like file transfers, etc..), you
can always Exit/Shell from your comm program (make sure not to drop
carrier) and then start UUTERM. Just make sure to answer NO when asked if
you want to dial a BBS (no need to dial since you are already online).

When using this method, make sure your comm program connects to the BBS
at the same settings you have configured in UUTERM. Simply go to UUTERM's
F8 menu (do this offline). Jot down the modem settings (baud, port,
handshaking, etc), and set your comm program to use the same settings.

Then call your BBS with your comm program. Do your e-mail, file transfers,
etc.. When ready to play UU, exit your comm without dropping carrier
(if you are shelling, you should set your comm program to swap itself to
XMS/EMS), start UUTERM. Play UU.

When done playing you can log off the BBS while in UUTERM, or exit UUTERM
and return to your comm program.

If you decide that after playing UU, you need to get back in your comm
program, you can do so without having to redial the BBS. Simply exit
UUTERM and start your comm program WITHOUT sending the modem init string.
In Telemate, you would use the /O switch to do this.

Example: You logged onto the BBS with UUTERM. Now your done playing
         and you want to d/l some files. Naturally you'll need your comm
         program to do the file transfers. So after playing UU, exit 
         UUTERM, go to your Telemate directory and start Telemate by
         typing: TM /O
         Bingo.. you still online and now your comm program is in control.

How to use UUTERM 

Previously I explained how to start UUTERM and how to correct any
problems when running it. So this section will focus on the features
in UUTERM and how to use them to your best advantage.

   ------------------   Summary of UUTERM Keys   -----------------------
       ("*" denotes a feature only found in the registered version)

    *<ALT> P  Port Locater/Scanner          F1   View Files
                                            F2   Set Alarm
     <ALT> W  Recorder                      F3   Toggle Capture File

    *<ALT> C  Cabal Manager                 F5   Display Ship's Inventory
     <ALT> Z  Toggle UUTERM Display         F6   Explore Sectors
                                            F7   Macro Menu
     <ALT> X  Exit UUTERM                   F8   Config Menu
                                            F9   Shell To Dos
    *<ALT> F  Flea Market Scanner           F10  Utility Menu

       ---------------------------------------------------------------------

             >>>>>>>>>>>  F1 - VIEW FILES   <<<<<<<<<<<<

Selecting this feature allows you to view 3 type of files.

1) Help. Displays the icons and what each one represents. Those enclosed
   within the red box are those reserved for registered users.

2) Scrollback Buffer. Use this to view lines that have already scrolled
   off the screen. Buffer is configured by default for 140 lines.

3) Text File. With this you can view any text file in the current
   directory. 

             >>>>>>>>>>>  F2 - SET ALARM  <<<<<<<<<<<<

Don't be caught in space defenseless. This handy feature can be
programmed to sound an alarm when time is about to expire.

Simply find out how much time you have left (hit IS or use TIME AWARE if
have one), then push F2. Here you will prompted as to how long to play
before being warned. (Example: You want the alarm to sound 4 minutes
before time expiration. If you have 34 minutes left, then you want to be warned
in 30 minutes. Enter 30 at the prompt).

Once the alarm is set, it can not be turned off. Thus you won't make a
mistake and accidently turn it off. However, (if for some reason you
need to) there is a way to bypass the alarms circuitry and thus force
it to not go off. Simply enter a time longer than you have to play.
Thus it will never reach it.

Once the alarm has been activated, and you need to reset the alarm time,
simply hit F2 again and enter a new time.

                  >>>>>>>   F3 - STARLOG   <<<<<<<<<

Use this to open and close a capture file. Each time you open a capture
file you can add a distinctive name to it. The file is then given an
extension of .LOG automatically.

This is real helpful in recording your playing session. You can also use it
to save just portions of a playing session. For instance, start one
called NEWS.LOG that will contain just the news you read. Another called
PLANET.LOG that contains info on your planets.

If the file you specify already exists, you will be given the choice to
overwrite (create a new file) or append (add to existing file) to the
existing file.

               >>>>>>>>  F4 - SHIPS BAYS  <<<<<<<<<<<

This option will display what's in your ships device bays. UUTERM gets
this info when you run the "U" command from UU's main prompt. To update
the Ships Bays screen you will also need to run the "U" command again.

This won't keep you from using UU's "U" command entirely, but you should be
able to cut down on it's use about 50% of the time. Thus saving you some
time.

You can also use your devices right from UUTERM's Ships Bays screen.

               >>>>>>>>  F5 - SHIP INVENTORY  <<<<<<<<<<

This feature uses the IS command to diaplay your ships inventory. Must be
at UU's main command prompt for it to work.

              >>>>>>>>  F6 - EXPLORE SECTORS  <<<<<<<<<<
    To use this feature, you will need the SECTOR FINDER PACK (#168)

When you choose to run this UUTERM feature, you will be asked 3 questions:

1) Manual or Automatic mode.
2) the sector you want to start at
3) how many times or turns do you want to program it for before you will
   be asked to reprogram it.

Let's examine each of these prompts in more detail so you can understand
the real usefulness of this feature.

1) Manual or Automatic mode.
   In manual mode you will need to push F6 for each path you wish to
   scan. With automatic mode you won't need to keep pressing F6, all paths
   to be scanned are run all at once.

   Automatic mode also offers an extra advantage. When done exploring you
   are asked if you want to save to disk all info on found Cabal and
   planets.

   In manual mode you can still save this info to disk but you'll
   have to do it yourself manually by opening a .LOG file (F3) before
   running F6 in manual mode, then scanning that .LOG file after done with
   manual exploration. You can scan it by running ALT-C (Find Cabal).

2) What sector to start at. 
    Specify here a starting sector of your exploration. You can specify
    any sector of the universe. When the exploration feature starts, it
    will plot and scan paths from the sector you are currently in to
    the sector you specified here and all following sectors.

    Thus in one playing session.. you could explore sector 100 thru 200,
    then in the next session, specify 201 here and you will pick up from
    where you left off last session.

    UUTERM has a window on the display screen, called LAST. This shows the
    last sector explored. The next time you program the F6 feature, you'll
    know where you left off.

3) How many turns.
    This prompt asks how many times you want to program your explore for.
    Each time uses one turn. So by specifying 100, you will be allowed
    to plot 100 paths for exploration before being asked to reprogram this
    feature.
    
    Warning though, you can't reprogram the F6 option again until you
    have used up the number of turns being specified here. So use smaller
    numbers here if you don't want to be locked into lots of exploration.
    You can always add more later but never take away.

NOTE: 

This feature increments the explored sector by 2. This means the
destination sector of your exploration will be advanced 2 sectors from the
last one explored. In other words, you explore every other sector. However,
you'll probably pass thru the other half also during your exploration.
Thus you don't need to waste turns by plotting paths to all sectors.

Example: Start at sector 20 for 10 turns.

         This feature then plots a path from your current sector to sector
         20. If you specified manual mode, then you need to press F6 again
         to plot/scan the next path. If in automatic you don't need to
         press F6.

         The next path wil be incremented by 2. So it plots a path from
         your current sector to sector 22. Then to sector 24, then 26, etc.

         As it plots the paths it also scans them and reports all findings.
         Why it's wise to start a capture file before running this feature.

                >>>>>>>>  F7 - MACRO MENU  <<<<<<<<<<

This option allows you to program up to 20 macros that you can use while
on-line. You can create/edit/delete macros and descriptions, on-line or off.

UUTERM can run two types of macros:

1) .MAC files.  This is a text file with an extension of .MAC. This file
   can hold 10 lines of 80 characters each, or 800 character total for
   your macro. That's one huge macro capability. 

   These macros can be created by you in a word processor/text editor.
   There are also other UU utilities like UUDEVICE that create .MAC files
   for easy buying of devices. UUTERM is compatible with these other
   utilities and can run these .MAC files for you.

2) The other type of macro is an editable macro. These are saved in a text
   file called MACROS.UUT. You can create these macros off-line or while
   on-line. 

   Create these like you do in UU. Run them at anytime by pressing <ALT>
   and the letter of the macro you want to run. Just like in UU but use
   <ALT> instead of <CTRL>.

Other possible uses could be to plan your moves off-line, create a text
file that has the commands you want to execute when on-line, then use
this to run the text file and automatically execute your moves.

After you play with it, I'm sure you'll start coming up with all kinds of
idea's for it's use.

NOTE: This feature may not work at all times with large macros. I have
      found that this feature is affected by the way the SYSOP has set up
      UU. Some BBS's don't use a line wrap which can cause problems.
      My advice is to use at your own risk. However to ensure success, you
      may have to break a large macro into 2 or more macros.

There is a special "FLIP" button that adds for toggling between macro and
description. To add a description just type it in as you would a macro.

If you would like to create the MACROS.UUT file off-line in a word processor
the format is as follows:

1) Add a "'" to the beginning of the description line
2) put the description line above the macro line

Not all macros need to be described.
Here are some examples of proper format:

EXAMPLE 1 (both macros described):

'this macro does todays news when at the Main prompt
C;N:1
'moves to sector 10 from sector 1
M;9;M;10

EXAMPLE 2 (only second macro described):

C;N;1
'moves to sector 10 from sector 1
M;9;M;10
V;235;V;171;1;1%

If all this is confusing to you, then create your macros and descriptions
in UUTERM. Then Exit UUTERM or Shell to DOS and examine the MACROS.UUT file
to see the format it is created in.

               >>>>>>>>   F8 - CONFIG MENU   <<<<<<<<<<<

Used for setting your modem configuration, size of scrollback buffer,
if sound should be on or off, and more.

               >>>>>>>>  F10 - UTILITY MENU  <<<<<<<<<<<

This menu allows you to run other programs while on-line. These programs
can be on any drive and in any directory you specify (as long as it is
valid). This is most useful for running 3rd party utilities for UU, but
you can also use it to run any piece of software.

If the file is in the current directory all you need do is enter the name
of the program to run along with any command line parameters it uses.
If the file is on another drive or in another directory, then you will
need to enter the full path also.

Example: Suppose you want to run UUDEVICE which is in another directory
you would enter something like...

C:\com\uudev\uudevice

Now, no matter where UUTERM is being run from, you have access to it.

Should UUTERM not locate the file, an error message will be displayed.
However should it exist and you attempt to run it, but it doesn't work,
then chances are you don't have enough memory for the other utility to run.
UUTERM can not check for this since it has no way of knowing memory
requirements for all the utilities out there.

TIP: You can also use this feature to run DOS commands (much easier then
     shelling to DOS).

               >>>>>>>>  <ALT> Z - TOGGLE DISPLAY  <<<<<<<<<<<

This option allows for elimination of UUTERM's graphic screen.

               >>>>>>>>  <ALT> P - PORT FIND  <<<<<<<<<<<
                      (Registered version only)

This feature finds ports that sell all (great for starting a planet), ports
that buy all (great for unloading excess commodities from a planet), and
the best ports for trading. (this is the same thing as my UUPORT utility)

To gather this info, UUTERM needs a text file to scan. Simply go to sector
8. Dock at the port, then start a capture file of the port report. UUTERM
can work with either the Personal or Computer format.

All info on the best ports is saved to disk in a file with the extension of
.POR. These best ports are appended to the .POR file, so there is no need
to scan all the sectors at once.

In fact I recommend only doing 1000-1500 sectors at a time. The reason being
UUTERM has no way of knowing how large your universe is. So I've only set
aside enough memory to handle about 1500 sectors at a time. I think you
will find this more than plenty. And remember, you can always go back and
do another 1500 sectors if need be. All info from a current and previous
scan is saved in the .POR file for viewing at any time.

               >>>>>>>>  <ALT> F - FLEA FIND  <<<<<<<<<<<
                      (Registered version only)

This baby I truly like, especially so in games where there is 150 or more
devices at the Flea Market. Why pay full price? Get 2-3 times as many
drones, mines, etc.. for your money.

Before you can run this feature, you need to get a listing of what is
available at the Flea Market.

Go to sector 6 and port. Then start a capture file called FLEA.LOG or
whatever. Then view the entire market listing, when done close the capture
file. Now you can search the flea market at any time, and get a listing
of the devices you want at the lowest prices. Why pay full price for drones,
mines, and other items?

When asked for a text string to search for, keep in mind these points. Your
text string must be greater than one character in length. Also the search
is case sensitive. So if you want to look for drones, enter "Drones", not
"drone". Of course if you don't like the extra hassle of entering a capital
letter, then search for drones using "rones".

               >>>>>>>>  <ALT> W - RECORDER  <<<<<<<<<<<

This baby is like the black box in an airplane. It records your every move.
This feature comes in handy when working off-line. As you may have noticed,
to run many of the registered features you need to open and close capture
files while playing. So how do you create a capture file of your entire
session then? Simply by starting this while on-line. Then when off-line
you can replay your entire session and capture it then (in case you need
one for UUSCAN or some other utility).

Also handy in reviewing mistakes you may have made, or reviewing something
you may have missed. Or perhaps to give to a teammate so he can gather info
from your playing session.

When running this off-line you can push the <PAUSE> key to temporarily halt
the display.

One word of caution though. This feature requires lot's of free disk space
for saving your playing session. Probably about 300-400K per 30 minutes of
play at 2400 baud. (Don't be concerned about size if you want to u/l to a
teammate. Since it is a text file, a 1 hour session will PKZIP to about
50K.)

            >>>>>>>>  <ALT> C - CABAL MANAGER  <<<<<<<<<<<
                      (Registered version only)

This key performs two functions. Scans a capture file for any Cabal drones
and saves the info to disk in a file called CABAL.LST. This can be run on
or off-line. Then if you like you can have it report the Cabal for you.

BONUS: while it scans the .LOG for Cabal, it'll also keep an eye out for
       any planets found and save them in PLANET.LST

NOTE:
If you want it to report, then you must either port in sector 5, or start
your EECC calling device (this device can be purchased separately in UU or
found in the Cabal Invasion Pack, Starter Pack, Fed Pack, etc..).
When you are at the ports prompt, then start your reporting.

If you report all the Cabal in your list (Cabal.Lst) then your list is
automatically erased from disk. If you report only a portion, then only
those reported are deleted from Cabal.Lst.

TIP #1: If you are running a capture file while you play and then scan it
     for Cabal, then report. Then do it again 20 minutes later on your now 
     larger capture file. You'll find that in many instances you'll be
     reporting the same Cabal over. 

     To work around this, you may only want to report at the end of your
     session. But if you find you must report more than once in a playing
     session (in case you need the credits right away), I recommend you
     start a capture file before you do your exploring, then turn it off
     before you do the reporting. When done reporting, start another
     capture file for the next reporting session. In this manner, you
     should be able to reduce the number of duplicate reports.

TIP #2: If you press ALT-C by mistake and really don't want to report/scan
     for Cabal, then just press <ENTER> to escape.

TIP #3: Sometimes you may wish to save CABAL.LST for later perusal. I handle
     this in the following manner: 1) I created a .BAT file that copies
     CABAL.LST to another directory. 2) In UUTERM's Utility Menu I run the
     .BAT file. In this manner I can save my lists anywhere I want all at
     the push of a button.
